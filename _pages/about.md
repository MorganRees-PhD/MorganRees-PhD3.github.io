As a PhD student in Mathematics at the University of Kent, I am passionate about exploring the properties and applications of topological solitons, which are stable solutions of nonlinear differential equations that arise in various fields of physics. I have a strong background in mathematics and its applications, having completed my MS and BS degrees in Mathematics at the same university with distinction. I have developed skills in applied mathematics, statistical computing, and data analysis, which I use to conduct original research and publish papers in peer-reviewed journals. I also collaborate with other researchers and professors and participate in seminars and workshops to share my findings and learn from others. My goal is to contribute to advancing mathematical knowledge and its interdisciplinary applications and pursue a career in academia or industry that allows me to apply my skills and expertise to solve real-world problems.
